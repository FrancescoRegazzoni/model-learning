# Model Learning #

Matlab (R) library for model learning and model reduction. The main methods and algorithms implemented in the library have been introduced in the papers [1,2], wherein they are derived and documented.

For information about the installation and usage of the library, check out the [documentation](https://model-learning.readthedocs.io).
