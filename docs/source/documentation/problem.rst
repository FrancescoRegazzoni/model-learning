The struct ``problem``
============================================================

What is a problem?
-------------------------------

In this library, a **problem** corresponds to some physical, social, economical **time-dependent phenomenon** that we aim at describing in mathematical terms.
It mainly consists in the definition of the input-output variables (how many they are, which are the bounds for each variable). 
Notice that a problem does not contain any information about the map linking inputs to outputs: such map is rather defined by a :ref:`model<model>`, which is a different concept. Indeed, for a given problem one may have several models.

Each problem must be contained in an :ref:`example<example>`. Notice that, however, every :ref:`example<example>` can contain more that one problem.

How is a problem represented?
-------------------------------

A problem is represented as a `MATLAB struct <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/struct.html>`_.

To easiest (and safest) way of generating a problem struct is to define its features through an ``.ini`` file. The full list of tags to define a problem is available in ``\examples\problem_example.ini``. Then, the problem ``struct`` can be generated by the command: ::

	problem = problem_get('EXAMPLE_NAME','PROBLEM_DEFINITION.ini');
